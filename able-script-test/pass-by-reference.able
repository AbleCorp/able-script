owo Pass-by-reference test

owo Swap two variables.
functio swap(left, right) {
    var tmp = left;
    left = right;
    right = tmp;
}

var foo = "hello";
var bar = "world";

swap(foo, bar);

if (foo != "world") {
    "FAILED" print;
    "foo should be 'world', is actually:" print;
    foo print;
}

owo AbleScript doesn't have an `else` statement (yet), so we get to
owo check the reverse condition.
if (foo == "world") {
    "OK" print;
}
